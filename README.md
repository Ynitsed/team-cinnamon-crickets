# Cookups OverView
Think of Cookups as the "Google for Recipes"! Cookups allows you to search for recipes based on your available ingredients. Cookups users can rate recipes, add comments on recipes and also recipes on social networking sites. In addition, Cookups also allows users to signup and register on our website. Once user register with Cookups, they become Cookup members and they can create their own recipe diaries, add their personal recipes to their recipe diary, keep track of food they have cooked in past and bookmark their favourite recipes. All you have in your house is cheese, milk, bread, and dog biscuits? Well check out our site to see what crazy concoctions you can make! Sadly, dog biscuits aren't in our database, but boy can you find some gourmet delectables with easy ingredients that can truly wow your friends. Ever seen the move Ratatouille? With this site on hand, you could destroy even that culinary genius of a mammal on any Iron Chef or Hell's kitchen. Move over Ramsey,user is here to demolish your taste buds, implore you curiosity, and lavish your essence in the finer luxuries demonstrated upon entrance to this easy to get to site. The best part is, you can brag about your delicious finding AND creations (yes, recipes are customizable, your own database of deliciousness, take that supercooks), by grabbing a membership today. Interested? Good. Hungry? Great. Thirsty? Amazing. Have dental issues? We can't really do much about that, you should go to the doctors or something. But we can fill your sickly mouth with the pleasure it deserves.
