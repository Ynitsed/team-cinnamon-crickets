# Cookups OverView
Think of Cookups as the "Google for Recipes"! Cookups allows you to search for recipes based on your available ingredients. Cookup users can rate recipes, add comments on recipes and also recipes on social networking sites. In addition, Cookups also allows users to signup and register on our website. Once user register with Cookups, they become Cookup members and they can create their own recipe diaries, add their personal recipes to their recipe diary, keep track of food they have cooked in past and bookmark their favourite recipes.
