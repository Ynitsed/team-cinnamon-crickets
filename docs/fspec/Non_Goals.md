# Non-Goals
[Edited by Isaac Vawter, 10/16/2014]

The design of cookups.org is intended to fully satisfy our users while placing the minimum burden on our investors. To accomplish this we have established non-goals to eliminate unnecessary development costs. Our website will not be using cookies to store user information between visits. All user-specific information will be stored on the cookups.org server and will be accessible to the user after they log onto the site. Our website will not feature a sophisticated email-based password recovery system, but may incorporate a hints-based system instead. Cookups.org will not include social networking elements such as inter-user messaging, friending or following. We will not be verifying the accuracy of categorical information contained in the recipes displayed on cookups.org such as calorie count or allergy information. Our users will be informed of this when they use our site and will be encouraged to only use recipes that contain ingredients that are safe for their consumption.
