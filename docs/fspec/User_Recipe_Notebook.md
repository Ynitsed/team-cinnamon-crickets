## User's Recipe Notebook
[Edited by Isaac Vawter, 10/16/2014]

Each registered user on cookups.org will have their own personal recipe notebook. The _My Recipe Notebook_ page is a virtual representation of the user's recipe book and will consist of three sections: pantry items, personal recipes, and recipe search. 

### Pantry Items

Pantry items are a list of items representing the ingredients that the user always has on hand. These items will automatically be included in any recipe searches made by the user. This will greatly improve the user's experience by saving them time when searching for recipes. The items will be listed on the screen under the title “Pantry” along with a button that allows the user to add or remove ingredients from the list. Clicking the “Add/Remove Items” button will navigate the user to the _Set Pantry Items_ page, which sole purpose is for editing a user's pantry items. 

### Personal Recipes

The second section of the page, personal recipes, will be a list of all the recipes added by the user and will be displayed under the title “Recipes.” There will also be an “Add Recipe” button at the bottom of the list, which will navigate the user to the _Add Recipe_ page, allowing them to add a recipes to the list. Each recipe will be accompanied by a view and edit button. The view button will navigate the user to the standard recipe view page. The edit button will navigate the user to the _Add Recipe_ page with the fields initially set to correspond with the original recipe. This section allows the user to quickly find recipes they've added to the site and improve them whenever they desire. 

### Recipe Search

The recipe search area of the page will be similar to the recipe search featured on the homepage of cookups.org. This allows the user to search for recipes directly from their notebook, thus saving them from having to navigate back to the home page to make recipe searches.

## Add Recipe

Registered users of cookups.org will be able to add recipes to our database using the _Add Recipe_ page. This improves the experience of all users of cookups.org by increasing the number of recipes available to them and allowing registered users to store their recipes on our website. This page is accessible from the user's _My Recipe Notebook_ page and is divided into three sections: Ingredients and Amounts, Categories, and Directions. At the bottom of the page there is an "add recipe" button as well as a "make this recipe public" box. The "make this recipe public" box allows the user to choose which of their recipes they share with other users of the website.

### Ingredients and Amounts

Within the "Ingredients and Amounts" section of the page, the user starts off by selecting ingredients from a drop-down list. Each added ingredient is displayed with a field for the user to enter the amount of that ingredient needed for the recipe. The ingredients also have a remove button so that the user can delete ingredients that were added by accident.

### Categories

The categories section of the page allows the user to classify their recipe according to different categories. These categories may include calorie count, preparation time, general flavor, degree of spiciness, food origin, etc. This is especially important with recipes the user flags as public, because it makes it easier for other users to find the recipe when browsing or searching by category.

### Directions

The directions section of the page is just a large field for the user to enter directions. This gives the user freedom to be as detailed or concise as they wish when explaining the preparation of the recipe. Any details and instructions that the user might not be able to specify in the other sections can be included in the directions section.
