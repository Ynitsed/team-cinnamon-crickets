Once logged in, each user will be able to navigate to their personal cookbook, pantry, and editable profile and settings.

### Login User
When logging in, a user provides their username and password. They are then brought back to the main landing page, but now with their username visibly logged in on the mane page. Selecting the username will present the user controls.

### User Controls
Once logged in, the user can access these controls by clicking the username, displayed at the right of the top navigation bar. These controls contain user-related functionality, including 'Add Recipe', 'CookBook', 'MyProfile', 'Pantry', and 'LogOut'. Selecting the AddRecipe user control will direct the user to the Add Recipe page within the user's cookbook. Similarly, the CookBook control will lead to the main Cookbook view, and the Pantry control will lead to the Pantry view.

The user will no longer be logged in, and be directed back to the main landing page.

If the MyProfile User Control is selected, the user is brought to an editable profile page. The left most pane of this page will display the User Controls, allowing easy access to the user functionality.

This will present the user's public profile, displaying a non-editable version of their profile, displaying name, bio, and favorite recipes. The public profile will also display the user's sumbitted recipes, which will each lead to their appropriate recipe page.
