### Why COOKUPS ###

* Tired of eating out?
* Bored with cooking the same food?
* Want to get creative with your ingredients?


### COOKUPS will spice up your life! ###

<img src="./pictures/eat_black.png" alt="cost" width="600">
* CookUps generates recipes for your ingredients.
* CookUps gives you calorie counts for our food.
* CookUps stores your favorite home recipes.


### What makes COOKUPS unique ###

* CookUps differs from the competition in that it is easy to browse recipes by multiple different fields not only ingredients. We give our users convenience, tasty food and fitness under one roof. You may browse recipes by recipe name, food allergies, ingredient names, allowed diet, cuisine preference, food course, holiday and season, preparation time, flavors, calories, and nutrients. Unlike our competititor's websites, CookUps is not just a cooking website, but it also caters to your health and convenience.
* CookUps is self-contained website that offers you all under one roof. Unlike our competitors, e.g. Supercooks, we do not sprawl the web for recipes and redirect the user to other websites. Instead, we have our own database from Yummly and we never redirect the user to another website. We provide all the information our user needs on our website and since we look for recipes in our database, not the web, we avoid dublication of recipes. This means that if you get 5 search results, you have 5 different dishes and not just 5 variants of one dish. *DISCLAIMER : Not in Beta release*
* Once a recipe is found CookUps will make a shopping cart for you of needed ingredients. If you have everything great, if not our shopping list makes it easy to run to the store and pick up missing ingredients.
* Cookups makes cooking fun by adding a social component to cooking. You may add and share recipes on Cookups. We make Cookups highly personalized for the user since our members can add your favorite recipes to CookUps' local database and you can access them from anywhere and/or share them with your friends.
* Cookups also keeps track of the food the members decide to cook in members personal accounts so that our members may keep track of your diet using Cookups. *DISCLAIMER : Not in Beta release*
 

### Problem Statement
Food is a huge part of life, for obvious reasons, we need it to live. But sometimes, you may not have all the ingredients of a 5 star French resturant, but still want to make a nice meal. But not just that, you want to make a nice meal with what you have AND when you come up with that delicious meal, you want to share it with your friends. A website that helps the baking and cooking illiterate excel would be ideal.
Moreover, the problem is not just cooking tasty food conveniently, but also making sure that the food you eat is healthy and is in line with your dietary restrictions and nutritional needs.
Along with that, Instagram became incredibly popular for just taking photos of the food they eat, our site focuses around those foods to be shared when someones idea for a great recipes comes to life. Now people can try all the cool mixes you come up with for food, while we keep track of the health benifits of it for you with diet tracks. When you only have a few things to cook with, we can help you get the optimum outcome for that food. This will be a very multifunctional site that focuses on food, recipes, health, and sharing

#### Our Product

* Main
To make a food site that focuses around giving you a wonderful cook given the ingredients you have, or if you have a select amount of ingredients, making a great recipe to add and share, also a health aspect that helps you to choose healthy foods if you so please.

#### Related Courses

* CS 187: We need to be able to store many types of data in data structures such as usernames, passwords, recipies, categories, and being able to create and navigate these will be crucial.

* CS 220: Design Patterns will be needed and will be important due to that fact that with all our features, we need to be able to add or remove features that people want, a flexible code will be essential for this to happen.

* CS 345 Practice and Application of Data Management: CookUps will need a robust database as the backbone of the application and the team will use knowledge from 345 to create such a database. This will include efficient queries to search said database even with large amounts of data involved. This will be done using Postgresql which was taught in 345.

* Philosophy 360: Ethics are important because we want to figure out what in life is intrinsicly good, and what is not, this way we can decide how to best get the most intrinsically good site we can get!

* Economics: We performed a market analysis of consumer needs and realized that people wanted healthy and tasty food that they can conveniently cook under one roof. Thus, we are creating a website that gives consumers culinary excellence and health tracking at their convenience. We performed a SWOT (Stregth, Weakness, Opportunity and Threat) analysis of our different ideas and came to the conclusion that CookUps is the most strong idea for our product.

Also nutrition and food courses would be a bit needed, but as we are using an API that has most of that information, its almost not needed!
