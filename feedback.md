# Project 04 Feedback

AWESOME. This is a fantastically detailed document.

As an aside, I noticed some of the pictures on your md files aren't showing up.

As a general note, I hope that all team members are taking responsibility and initiative. I know that this isn't always the case in group projects. Remember, just because you are in the same group doesn't mean you will all wind up with the same final grade... Individual contributions matter!

GitHub activity: Some team members have way more commits than others. Lots of commits in the last 2 weeks.

Trello activity: Decent.

Meeting notes: Also decent. Thanks for keeping up with these.

I give your submission the following rating:

**Strong Thumbs Up**

Good work!

# Project 03 (Round 2) Feedback

Please take this feedback.md out of the "classwork" folder and put the file back in the top level.

It does not look as though any updates have been made since the last round of comments, so the previous rating of **Weak Thumbs Up** stands.

# Project 03 Feedback

Let's walk through this section by section.

* Name – name of the system including the authors and when it was last updated.

Think of this like a title page. Should have the full names of your team members as well as when the document was last updated. By listing the date of last update at the head of the doc, you make it easier for me to know if a change has been made that I should take a look at. 

* Team Organization – The structure of your development team and responsibilities.

Typo in the description for Evan and Isaac. Good otherwise.

* Overview – a description of the system and disclaimer.

Sufficient, but not very engaging. Maybe move the Why Cookups? section into the Overview?

* Scenarios – how the system will be used.

Grammatical issues. Improper integration of quotes. The tone is weird. The Jasper scenario is one long sentence... The ideas are generally fine, but they are not written well. Please edit this.

* Non-Goals – the features that will not be implemented.

Great detail.

* Flowchart – a flowchart showing paths through the system and important screens.

Doesn't fully match up with the screen-by-screen. Where is the Notebook?

* Screen-by-Screen – a screen-by-screen specification of the system.

Woah... Seems like 3 different styles were used for these which is pretty strange. Use one consistent approach. Would have liked to see a short description underneath the image. Definitely update these as you make progress on the project...

There is a decent amount of activity the weeks of Oct 12 and Oct 19, but next to nothing the week of Oct 26. Good to see an increase in commits from some members. Would be great to see this from all of you...

No Trello activity since Oct 26... Your meeting notes could be better.

Remember to update this as you move through the project. I'll be taking a look at it periodically. I will adjust your grade higher if and when the document improves.

# Project 02 (Round 2) Feedback

Glad to see you have addressed the uniqueness of your application. I definitely have a better understanding of the value of your application now.

Great Problem Statement!

You did some serious work on the Cost section. I'm impressed. I think your total costs for FY are a bit off. Looks like one too many zeros in the totals. 

I see you have updated your Trello and meeting notes. Thanks for putting in the effort and making all of these changes.

Your proposal is far stronger now. I’m convinced! I give your submission the following rating:

**Strong Thumbs Up**

Your project has been fully funded. Good work!

# Project 02 (Round 1) Feedback

Engaging logo and good bios.

Where is your problem statement? Where are the courses that characterize the problem? Where is your problem description? The bullet points at the beginning of the document are not sufficient!

Seems like your team roles are not divvied up very much. I would like to see more of a division of work (or maybe just add specifics as time goes on) so that it is easier to follow who is responsible for what.

Cost section is alright. What is meant by "logistics"? What are you using for a database that would bring the total to $3000? What about marketing? Don't need exact numbers, but want to see that the numbers you put are supported by a little research.

Love the detail in the timeline. Good format too as the list approach will make it easier to update over time. My only concern is that there is no mentioning of research! 

On that note, have you heard of supercook.com? Currently, I'm not seeing how your application is much different than that one...
THIS HAS TO BE ADDRESSED SOMEWHERE. 

Only one commit the week of Oct 5th? You should be in the habit of making commits frequently. It is good practice and a great habit to get into. Plus, we are keeping track of this! (As well as if some team members commit more than others!)

Trello activity is lacking. You need to have a DONE section on your Trello board!!! If you have already accomplished some tasks and did not create a card then you should create a card in the DONE list to show us what you did. I am keeping track of what tasks are completed by each team member, so it is in your best interest to get more activity on here and keep track of who does what! 

Your team meeting notes need to be on github. It is a part of your grade. Please give more details in your notes as well. Research, brainstorming, pretty much anything you have been doing to get this thing going. While I am here to grade you, I am also here to help get you a better grade and advocate for your team. The more information you can give me, the better I understand what is going on.

At this time I give your submission the following rating:

**Thumbs Down**

I am not entirely sold on this idea. There are missing components in your proposal and I need to understand how this is a unique application. Please take the time to review the above comments and make the appropriate changes to this document! Per the assignment description, you have 72 hours to complete this. I will check back to see if you have made moves on this and update the feedback and your grade accordingly.

Sincerely,

A Venture Capitalist

Your logo is great. I'm very intrigued by your concept. Be mindful of other existing products that accomplish what you guys are looking to do! (I already have a few in mind...) Be prepared to distinguish yourselves. Solid meeting notes.

To make your profile stronger, you should mention how your CS/non-CS coursework relates your idea or how it could influence your contributions to the project. We will review this document again when we review P02.

You successfully used git and github to organize your project. Your profile.md file should be in your docs directory. Your activity on github is rather low, with 18 commits as of Tuesday. You must make sure to show more activity as low activity will hurt your grade. Good job using Trello and remember to continue doing so.

At this time I give your submission the following rating:

**Thumbs Up**

I hope to see more progress in Project 02. In particular:

* More Trello board activity
* More Github activity
