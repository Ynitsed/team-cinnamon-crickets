Throughly went through project assignment 4. As a group did our various part of the assignment and had each other for support during the process. Jon finished getting everything in the database working properly, has most of it completed, I am writing this as we code and write. Albert is writing like a mad man, as is Evan, on component by component. Mina is working to get the collabaration and slide show so everything runs smoothly. Patrick is making sure nothing is missing and writing wherever people have missed an area, editing, and doing revision history. Gabe is helping with the breakdown, Isaac is writing about external libraries with the help of Mina.
